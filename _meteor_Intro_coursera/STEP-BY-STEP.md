In this introductory course you will learn how to create a complete, multi-user web site using the Meteor.js framework and MongoDB. You will implement user authentication, security features, reactive templates and routing using iron router. You will also carry out key database operations such as inserting, removing and updating data as well as sorting and filtering. Finally, you will see how a complete application can be built, line by line.

This is the code of the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development

# Week 1 Introduction to Meteor
### Running version: ``` image_share_week1 ```
#### Load 3 images and reduce size to 50px on click

In this module we'll be installing Meteor tools, editing a template and learning how to define a template helper and template event listeners.
https://www.meteor.com/install

#### Installation in Windows
```
https://install.meteor.com/windows```
Or using [Chocolatey](https://github.com/meteor/meteor-chocolatey-installer):
```
choco install meteor
# Installs 1.7.0.5 and the course is built on 1.4.2.3

# Next command removes previous version before installing the new one
choco install meteor --x86 --params="'/RELEASE:1.4.2.3'"
```
*[Note](https://github.com/meteor/meteor-chocolatey-installer): Prior to Meteor 1.6, 64-bit versions were not available. Therefore, in order to install versions prior to Meteor 1.6, you'll also need to pass Chocolatey's --x86 option when running choco install on 64-bit Windows platforms.*

Installation is located in folder ```C:\Users\brjap\AppData\Local\.meteor```

This is the global installation:
```
meteor --version```
Now, for your project you may inherit this version or use another version of Meteor. This is specified in file:
```
<PROJECT_FOLDER>\.meteor\release```

To make it match with your global version, you could edit the file, from:
```
METEOR@1.4.2.3```
to
````
METEOR@1.7.0.5```

But this produces compatibility errors of packages when running at least in Windows. So let us keep the original version of the code.

#### Installation in Linux
```
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
curl "https://install.meteor.com/?release=1.4.2.3" | sh```

You will receive this output:

*Meteor 1.7.0.5 has been installed in your home directory (~/.meteor).
Writing a launcher script to /usr/local/bin/meteor for your convenience.
This may prompt for your password.*

To get started fast:
```
  $ meteor create ~/my_cool_app
  $ cd ~/my_cool_app
  $ meteor
```
*Or see the docs at:*  ```docs.meteor.com```

For uninstalling:
```
$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor
$ rm -rf ~/.meteor
```
For checking which version is installed:
```
$ cat ~/.meteor/release
$ meteor --version
$ meteor show meteor```

#### Then run the app of week 1
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/therobotacademy/devops-meteor meteor-source
$ mkdir ~/meteor-dev
$ cd meteor-dev
$ meteor create image-share --bare

$ cd image-share
$ cp -r ~/meteor-source/_meteor_Intro_coursera/week_1_image_share/* .

$ meteor
```
Alternatively you can build the app in the folder of the source code:
```
$ cd ~/meteor-source/_meteor_Intro_coursera/week_1_image_share/
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor
```
Each time you click an image, it will reduce its size to 50 px.
Reloading the page will restore the originals.

# Week 2 Databases and collections
We will be creating Mongo Collections and using Mongo find and insert operations. In addition, we will be looking at how to control a Bootstrap modal from Meteor and we will be using third party Meteor packages to add functionality.
- Create a mongodb collection
- Use mongodb find and insert operations
- Operate a Bootstrap modal from Meteor
- Use third party Meteor packages to add functionality

Place in the app folder the following files corresponding to week2:
- package.json
- image_share.js, .html, .css

```package.json``` contains two dependencies:
 - ```"babel-runtime": "^6.18.0"```
 - ```"bcrypt": "^0.8.7"```

 The second requires ```node-gyp```. So let's add this depedency in ```package.json```

 Then:
 ```
 meteor npm install```
 Check packages and versions:
```
 meteor npm list --depth=0```
Then run the app:
 ```
 meteor```


[TESTS UNDER WINDOWS 10 ------------------------------------]

 We will do it directly with native ```npm```, installing ```https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/node-v8.11.4-x64.msi```

 For installing it requires ```node-gyp```,
 as explained in ```https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp```:
```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
npm install node-gyp
npm install bcrypt@0.8.7```

[-------------------------------------------------------------------------------]
### Running version: ``` image_share_week2_a ```
#### Load 22 images in MongoDB and reduce size to 50px on click

For reseting the database you have to stop the server and run this command:
```
meteor reset```
Then run the app, and you will see that 0 images are reported.

Restart the app and finally the images will be loaded in MongoDB and the total count reported on the console.

### Running version: ``` image_share_week2_b ```
#### Remove one item from the collection (delete button)
From 6:45 of video [Better startup script, removing items from a collection](https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development/lecture/hZwo6/better-start-up-script-removing-items-from-a-collection)

### Next version: ``` image_share_week2_c ``` Star Rating and sorting
```
https://atmospherejs.com/barbatus/stars-rating
meteor add barbatus:stars-rating
meteor update less
```
After the last update, meteor reports this:
```
babel-compiler             upgraded from 6.13.0 to 6.24.7

# Week 3 User authentication
In this module we will be looking at adding a user authentication to your Meteor app and learning how to use Mongo filters. Finally, we will be using the Meteor reactive Session variable and we will implement an infinite scroll.
- Employ user authentication in your Meteor app
- Use mongodb filters
- Use the Meteor reactive session variable
- Create an infinite scroll function

# Week 4 Security and routing
In this module we will show you how to perform basic security testing on your app and how to implement basic data security features. In addition, we will look at how to organise Meteor application code and how to implement multiple routes using iron:router.
- Evaluate the basic security of your app
- Develop basic data security features
- Use folders to organise Meteor application code
- Use iron:router to implement routes
